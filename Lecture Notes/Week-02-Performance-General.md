# **Exercise Performance - Programming I**

## **Overview**
- **Tasks:** There are 6 tasks to be completed (or 5 depending on progress).
- **Deadlines:** These are strict. Only under certain conditions, such as providing a doctor's certificate, can a deadline be extended.
- **Scoring:** 
  - The tasks amount to a total of 25 points, distributed as follows: 2/3/4/4/4/8. However, this may change.
  - To pass, students need to secure over 50%, i.e., 13 points.
- **Submission:** Task solutions must be handed in via iLearn.
- **Announcement:** Tasks/topics will be introduced during lectures and can be found in the “Exercise Performance” section on iLearn.
  
## **General Rules**
- **File Submission:**
  - `.pde` files must be named as per the task description.
  - Students may have to submit multiple `.pde` files for later tasks.
  - Do not rename `.pde` files to `.java` or any other format.
  - If required to upload an image, ensure it's correctly named and in the right format.
  - Do not use ZIP or any other compression method for file uploads. Violating this rule will result in 0 points, even if you can upload multiple files.
- **Coding Style:** From the third task onwards, specific style guidelines will be provided.

## **Time Management**
- **Planning:** It's crucial to plan before programming, especially for the more challenging tasks. Sketching out ideas using pen and paper is recommended.
- **Starting Early:** Deadlines can sometimes be just a week away. Starting a day before the deadline isn't advised.
- **Correction Time:** While the professor and working students strive to correct tasks promptly post-deadline, it may take a week or more in some cases.

## **Duplicates**
- The professor uses a duplicate checker called Simian. Any double submissions will result in zero points.
- **Collaboration:** Students are encouraged to discuss solutions and review each other's code. However, direct code sharing is discouraged.
- **Duplicate Checker:** The tool used for checking duplicates can ignore comments, reformat the source code, and more. Based on past experiences, it has been accurate.
- **Expectation:** Ideally, no duplicates should be detected.

## **Notes on Using ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, and Other Tools**
- **Purpose of Studying:** It's all about enhancing one's ability to perform specific tasks, such as thinking like an engineer, math, programming, etc.
- **The Importance of Practice:** Learning and brain transformation come from practice and hands-on work.
- **Traditional vs. Modern Learning:** With the emergence of tools like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot, there's a risk of students avoiding the trial and error aspect of learning.
- **Caution:** Over-reliance on such tools can hinder learning, as they might prevent mistakes, which are vital learning opportunities.
- **Tough Tasks:** Challenges present the best learning opportunities.
- **Tool Usage in Courses:** In “Programming I”, tools like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot are prohibited. Using them and creating accidental duplicates will result in zero points. This policy changes in “Programming II”, where more details will be provided.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Make sure to follow all rules to avoid losing points.
- Focus on understanding and hands-on practice rather than looking for shortcuts.
- Utilize modern tools consciously and responsibly.
- Cherish challenges, as they offer the most significant learning opportunities.
