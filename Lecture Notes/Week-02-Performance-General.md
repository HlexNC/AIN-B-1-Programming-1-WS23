# Exercise Performance - Genera

- What is a .pde file?
- Duplicate Semian?
- Coding in Processing is similar to CS50 library, it has draw functions and println, for education. Is there a processing lybrary for VS-Code?

## Overview

The exercise performance (Programming I) in general:
▶ 6 tasks (or 5, depending on the progress)
▶ Deadlines are carved in stone (e.g. a doctors certificate for a
longer time period is necessary to apply for an elongation)
▶ Most likely: 25 Points in total (2/3/4/4/4/8). There may be
changes!
▶ > 50% (i.e. 13 points) required to pass
▶ Hand in of the tasks solutions via iLearn
▶ Topics are given on separate slide sets, the iLearn description
only contains a reference to the slide sets
▶ The tasks/topics are anounced in the lectures and put on iLearn
in the “Exercise Performance” section

## General Rules

General rules (i.e. when violated, less points are granted even if all
other tasks are fullfilled):
▶ The .pde file is named according to the task description. You
may hand in multiple .pde files in the later tasks. Do NOT
rename a .pde file to .java or something else.
▶ If an image should be uploaded, it must also be named
according to the task description (and have the correct format).
▶ Do NOT zip the files for upload (or use any other compresion
technique). You can upload multiple files! If this is violated, then
your result will be 0 points!
▶ From task 3 on, there will be certain sty

## Time management

▶ Some planing is required before programming, especially for the
later tasks (tip: Use pen and paper!).
▶ Start early - sometimes there is only a week until the deadline.
Starting the day before the deadline will not lead to good results.
▶ Me and my working students correct the tasks as soon as
possible after the deadline - but there is no guarantee. It will
sometimes take a week or longer.

## Duplicates

▶ I hate to be forced to do this to guarantee fairness.
▶ A duplicate checker (Simian) is applied. Double hand-ins: No
points!
▶ Talk about solutions together. Help each other out. Discuss each
others code after starting on your own. But don’t send code
around (or hand it directly over)!
▶ The duplicate checker ignores comments, variable names,
reformats the source code etc. In my experience (at the FAU
Erlangen, and my first year at the DIT): It was always correct.
▶ My wish: The result list comes out empty.

## Notes on using ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot etc.

▶ What you are currently doing by studying: Living through
process of transforming your brain to do certain tasks better (e.g.
thinking like an engineer, math, programming, ...)
▶ Believe it (or not): This transformation will only come with
practice and hands-on work. And it takes time.
▶ Traditional learning: Read about something (or watch a video,
look up in the web...) and try it out. Play with it. Have errors
and search for them. You will learn a lot by that!. The process
is more important for your learning than the result!
▶ Today: There are a lot of tools that prevent you from making
errors (or playing around): ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot...
▶ In general: When using them without conciousness of what you
actually doing, you will remove your possibilities to learn. Your
lecturers opinion: This will fall back on you (as you forgot to
train your brain) sometime.
▶ In your studies, some contents may seem meaningless or
practically irrelevant to you. Do not forget: Dealing/fighting
with them trains your brain!
▶ When something seems hard now: Well, that shows that there is
a good opportunity to learn!
▶ Sometimes, learning results show up years later...

▶ In “Programming I”, we take the “easy” way of dealing with
ChatGPT and similar tools:

**They are not allowed!.**

That means a duplicate accidently created by the usage of
ChatGPT/GitHub CoPilot is a duplicate and will yield 0 points.
▶ Do not copy code from the internet, but try it on your own!
▶ In “Programming II”, this changes - but then I’ll comment on the
tools a little bit more.
